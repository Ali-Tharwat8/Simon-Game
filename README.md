Simon Game is a memory-challenge game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game shows a sequence of colors (and sounds), and the player must repeat the sequence correctly. Each round, the sequence increases by one step, testing memory and concentration.

## 🚀 Features

- Classic **Simon memory gameplay**  
- Progressive levels: each correct replication adds one color to the sequence  
- Sound and visual feedback for button presses  
- Game over when you make a mistake — try again and beat your high score  
- Simple and responsive UI

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The game begins by flashing a random color (or button)  
2. The player must click the colored buttons in the same order  
3. If successful, a new color is appended to the sequence, and the next round starts  
4. If the player makes an error, the game ends  
5. Player’s score is the length (number) of correctly repeated sequences
